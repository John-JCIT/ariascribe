# Phase 4: Testing, Compliance & Production Deployment

## Overview
Comprehensive testing, compliance implementation, monitoring setup, and production rollout strategy. Timeline: Week 4.

## 1. Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Unit Testing Requirements
**Backend Services** (Jest):
- XML parser: Valid/invalid XML handling, field mapping accuracy
- Search service: Text search, semantic search, hybrid scoring
- Suggestion service: OpenAI integration, business rules, confidence scoring
- Database operations: CRUD, vector similarity, full-text search

**Frontend Components** (Vitest + React Testing Library):
- Search combobox: Debouncing, results display, selection handling
- SOAP analyzer: Input validation, suggestion display, error states
- Billing sidebar: State management, currency formatting, action handling

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
// Example test cases to implement
describe('MbsSuggestionService', () => {
  test('generates relevant suggestions for standard consultation')
  test('applies business rules correctly (GP vs specialist items)')
  test('handles malformed SOAP notes gracefully')
  test('respects confidence thresholds')
  test('logs suggestions for audit trail')
})
```

### 1.2 Integration Testing
**API Endpoints**:
- `/mbs/search` with various query types and filters
- `/mbs/suggest` with real SOAP notes from different specialties
- `/mbs/item/:id` for all common item numbers
- Error handling for OpenAI API failures

**Database Integration**:
- Test data ingestion with sample XML files
- Vector similarity search accuracy
- Full-text search relevance
- Performance under concurrent load

**tRPC Integration**:
- Query caching behavior
- Error propagation from backend to frontend
- Authentication middleware
- Rate limiting enforcement

### 1.3 End-to-End Testing (Playwright)
**Core User Journeys**:
1. **First-time user**: Land → sample SOAP → generate suggestions → view details
2. **Regular usage**: Paste real SOAP → analyze → add to billing → compare revenue
3. **Search workflow**: Search MBS items → filter by provider → view item details
4. **Mobile experience**: All flows on mobile viewport

**Performance Testing**:
- Load testing with k6: 100 concurrent users generating suggestions
- Database query performance with 5,600+ MBS items
- Vector search latency under load
- Memory usage during bulk suggestions

## 2. Compliance & Security

### 2.1 Medical Compliance
**Disclaimer Implementation**:
- Prominent disclaimer on all suggestion pages
- "For guidance only - not a substitute for clinical judgment"
- Link to official MBS and RACGP resources
- Clear indication this is AI-generated content

**Audit Trail Requirements**:
- Log every suggestion made (user, SOAP excerpt, suggestions, timestamp)
- Track user actions: accepted, dismissed, viewed details
- Immutable audit logs (append-only tables)
- Compliance report generation for practice managers

**Data Handling**:
- SOAP notes are processed but not permanently stored
- Only store first 500 characters for audit purposes
- No PHI (patient identifiable information) in embeddings
- All MBS data is public domain (no privacy concerns)

### 2.2 Security Implementation
**Authentication & Authorization**:
- JWT token validation on all MBS endpoints
- Row-level security (RLS) for multi-tenant suggestions
- Rate limiting: 30 searches/min, 10 suggestions/min per user
- Admin-only access to ingestion logs and statistics

**API Security**:
- Input validation: SOAP note length limits, SQL injection prevention
- OpenAI API key security: Environment variables, rotation capability
- CORS configuration for web app domain only
- Request/response logging for security monitoring

**Infrastructure Security**:
- Database connection encryption
- API endpoint HTTPS enforcement
- Secrets management for OpenAI keys
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

### 2.3 Privacy & Data Protection
**Data Minimization**:
- Process SOAP notes in memory only
- Store minimal context for audit (no full patient data)
- Automatic cleanup of old suggestion logs (12-month retention)
- No cross-tenant data leakage

**User Control**:
- Users can request deletion of their suggestion history
- Export functionality for audit compliance
- Clear data usage notices in UI

## 3. Monitoring & Observability

### 3.1 Application Metrics (Prometheus)
**Performance Metrics**:
```
mbs_search_duration_seconds{search_type, provider_type}
mbs_suggest_duration_seconds{consultation_type}
mbs_openai_api_duration_seconds{model}
mbs_database_query_duration_seconds{operation}
```

**Business Metrics**:
```
mbs_suggestions_total{status} // suggested, accepted, dismissed
mbs_searches_total{search_type}
mbs_users_active_daily
mbs_revenue_potential_aud{tenant_id}
```

**Error Metrics**:
```
mbs_api_errors_total{endpoint, error_type}
mbs_openai_failures_total{error_code}
mbs_database_errors_total{operation}
```

### 3.2 Grafana Dashboards
**MBS Assistant Overview**:
- Active users (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Suggestion acceptance rate
- Average processing time
- Error rate and uptime

**Performance Dashboard**:
- API endpoint latencies (P50, P95, P99)
- Database query performance
- OpenAI API response times
- Cache hit rates

**Business Intelligence**:
- Top suggested MBS items
- Revenue opportunities by practice
- Consultation type breakdown
- Feature usage patterns

### 3.3 Alerting Rules
**Critical Alerts** (PagerDuty):
- MBS suggestion API error rate >5%
- Database connection failures
- OpenAI API quota exceeded
- Search latency P95 >2 seconds

**Warning Alerts** (Slack):
- Suggestion acceptance rate drops >20%
- XML ingestion failures
- High memory usage on workers
- Unusual traffic spikes

## 4. Production Deployment Strategy

### 4.1 Feature Flag Implementation
**LaunchDarkly Flags**:
```json
{
  "mbs_assistant_enabled": {
    "defaultValue": false,
    "targeting": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "variation": true,
          "conditions": [
            {"attribute": "tenantId", "op": "in", "values": ["beta-clinic-1", "beta-clinic-2"]}

- User reports of incorrect billing suggestions

**Rollback Process**:
1. Disable feature flag (takes effect in <30 seconds)
2. Database rollback if schema changes were made
3. Revert to previous application version if needed
4. Communicate status to affected users

### 4.4 Infrastructure Requirements
