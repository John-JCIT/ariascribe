# Aria Scribe Dashboard - Overview & Philosophy

## Vision Statement
Create the simplest possible clinical dashboard that maximizes doctor efficiency while minimizing cognitive load. The dashboard should feel like a natural extension of the doctor's daily workflow, not another system to learn.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- Every element must serve a clear clinical purpose
- No feature bloat or "nice to have" additions
- Maximum 3 clicks to complete any primary action
- Clean, uncluttered interface with plenty of whitespace

### 2. Doctor-Centric Design
- Built around the doctor's daily schedule, not software concepts
- Shows information in the order doctors need it
- Prioritizes speed and efficiency over comprehensive data display
- Reduces context switching between systems

### 3. EHR Integration Philosophy
- EHR systems remain the single source of truth
- Aria Scribe is a workflow accelerator, not a replacement
- Minimal data duplication - fetch what's needed, when needed
- Seamless handoff back to EHR system

### 4. Clinical Safety
- Clear consent verification workflows
- Obvious recording status indicators
- Easy access to patient safety information (allergies, warnings)
- Audit trail for all clinical actions

## Dashboard Purpose
The dashboard serves as the **daily command center** for clinicians using Aria Scribe. It should answer these key questions instantly:

1. **What's my schedule today?** (Appointment list)
2. **Who's my next patient?** (Current/upcoming appointments)
3. **What needs my attention?** (Pending notes, recordings to review)
4. **How efficient am I being?** (Basic productivity metrics)

## Success Metrics
- Time from login to starting first consultation: < 30 seconds
- Time from appointment click to recording start: < 45 seconds
- Doctor satisfaction with daily workflow efficiency
- Reduction in time spent on clinical documentation
- Zero patient safety incidents related to workflow confusion

## User Journey
```
Doctor arrives → Opens dashboard → Sees today's schedule → 
Clicks next appointment → Reviews patient summary → 
Verifies consent → Starts recording → Completes consultation → 
Reviews generated note → Pushes to EHR → Next patient
```

The entire flow should feel natural and require minimal training or memorization.
