### State Management Strategy
- **Zustand** for global application state
- **React Query** for server state and caching
- **Context API** for consultation-specific state
- **Local Storage** for user preferences and settings

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library for components
- **Integration Tests:** API integration with mock EHR services
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright for complete workflow testing
- **Performance Tests:** Load testing for audio processing
- **Security Tests:** Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development:** Local development with mock services
- **Staging:** Full integration with test EHR environment
- **Production:** Phased rollout with feature flags
- **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

   - Fallback: Generic FHIR integration as backup

2. **Audio Quality Issues**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive audio testing in clinical environments
   - Fallback: Manual transcription upload option

3. **AI Note Quality**
   - Mitigation: Extensive prompt engineering and testing
   - Fallback: Template-based note generation

### Clinical Risks
1. **Patient Safety**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive consent workflows and audit trails
